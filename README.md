###solved problems
|id|idea|
|-----|-----|
|113|dp, watch out for the many implementation details|
|116|dp, "normal" flow of idea would require a minus one at the end|
|118|dp, watch out for base cases|
|129|if you 'chunk' the repunits and apply this idea recursively you can get really far factoring repunits|
|131|same as 129|

###unsolved problems, confident
|id|idea|
|-----|-----|
|345|dp(i1,j1,i2,j2), 15**4=50625 states|
|148|plot the triangle and look for relations|
|122|dp|
|193|prime counting below 10^18 has a fast repo, and 10^18>2^50, add combinatorics|
|521|very nice problem, every other number has smpf 2, every 6 number has smpf 3, etc.|


###unsolved problems, not so confident
|id|idea|
|-----|-----|
|131|probably thue equation solver|
|160|track number of 2's and 5's and get last 5 digits of everything else factorial..too slow...look for cycles/patterns with some insights..|
|199|solve using centers, symmetry, etc. key algorithm for solving fourth circle's radius given 3 outer circles, special case for outer circle|

###unsolved problems, not confident
|id|idea|
|-----|-----|
|279|direction of attack: suppose angle is some random number say 34 degrees. show this is not doable with integral sides...perhaps use pi is irrational/transcendental.|
